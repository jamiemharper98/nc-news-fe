#NC News React App

The link to the deployed version of this app is at: https://nc-news-jh.netlify.app/


This app creates a webiste that consists of four pages that you can move around and you can look through a list of articles and pick one to read. If you happen to like (or dislike) the article then you can upvote or downvote the article, and if you wish you can also add a comment to let other users know your thoughts about the article you've just read.

This app provides the front end that accompanies the backend project that can be found at: https://github.com/jamiemharper98/nc-news

This project can be forked and cloned from github. The first thing to do when you have opened the code is to run 'npm i' in your terminal in order to install all packages relevant for this project. Then to run the development server you can run 'npm run dev' and you will be able to see the project as you continue to work on it.

This project requires a version of node of atleast 18.0.0.
